I don't want to write in much detail about this until I'm sure it's patched. Vaguely, I found a not-yet-adjusted market for content that was trivially generated by GPT and turned it into a ~$120/hr, minimally supervised money machine with some Python and macro automation. (Unfortunately there were daily, etc. limits that prevented me from running this 24/7 and retiring off it.) I also ended up separating the script into a client and API with a bespoke, device-fingerprinting license key DRM system (sorry) for reasons I may one day explain in a write-up.
