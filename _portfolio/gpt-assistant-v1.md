The first iteration of my custom LLM assistant. Built with Python/Flask and a Discord bot interface. This was in the early days of ChatGPT, and the goal was getting it to correctly solve problems with multiple steps and/or specific, objectively right answers. This really boiled down to using Google and being able to solve basic-ish math word problems. I had moderate success---it could accurately answer questions about things like celebrity ages, caloric content, and movie showtimes, and could correctly answer questions like "how long could I survive on 100 cans of black beans?" about 30% of the time. This was near-instantly obsoleted by the release of gpt-3.5-turbo and ChatGPT plugins.
