A prototype of an LED marquee sign to be mounted to the back of your car to communicate with drivers behind you. I built and designed the housing and sign itself and wrote an app to control it hands-free with Google voice---e.g., "hey Google, tell the guy behind me to stop tailgating me" or "oh my god I am so sorry". The sign is controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero running a Python program that communicates with the phone over Bluetooth. It also contains some additional components and wiring for power delivery.
