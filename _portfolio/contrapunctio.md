A website that uses the rules of species counterpoint to compose countermelodies to user-provided melodies. Built on a RESTful API written in Python with Flask and a simple vanilla JS/HTML/CSS web frontend. The site features a demo if you don't happen to have a suitable cantus firmus MIDI file on hand.
