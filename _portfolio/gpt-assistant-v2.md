A self-improving, voice-enabled, GPT-4-based assistant with multiple interfaces, written in Python. The design is very loosely inspired by the human brain, and with decent success---the latency is not great, but the bot makes fine conversation, follows instructions, and, upon my request, gave itself the ability to search Google, scrape my screen with OCR, and control my Spotify, among other things.
