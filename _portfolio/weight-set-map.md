A tool that generates KML maps of sporting goods stores across the U.S., color-coded by weight set availability. Implemented with a single Python script that calls an unrestricted inventory endpoint on a certain store's website. I used and updated these maps daily to make over $60/hr flipping weight sets in a post-quarantine secondhand home-gym market yet to adjust to recovering inventory. I experimented with a Shopify site and Google search ads, but stuck with craigslist because it had better margins.  Unfortunately, the market adjusted before I was able to tour the US in a U-Haul full of weight sets.
