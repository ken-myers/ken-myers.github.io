A tool that generates distance-optimized (as opposed to just flattened) 2D projections of the stars. Written in Python and based on the principles of self-organizing maps. Includes error indicators at both the star and map level. Generalized to I/O of any dimension, but with few use cases for anything above 3D. This is the first project I did a write-up on.
