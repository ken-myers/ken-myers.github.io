### About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer. I build, own, and operate production systems end-to-end (API, data, UI). I'm strong in Python, SQL, and modern web frameworks (TypeScript, React, Angular). My experience includes building multi-tenant SaaS platforms with GCP architecture/provisioning, ASP.NET Core APIs, and production-grade Python automations.
