i am a full stack software dev (at bank of america);
amateur musician and AI/ML researcher;
wannabe traveler, photographer, entrepreneur;
sometimes fitness enthusiast.

i made this site to showcase some of my projects, house the occasional writeup,
supplement my résumé,
and so my email domain wouldn't point to a registrar parking page.
