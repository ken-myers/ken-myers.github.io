I'm a high schooler from Texas. I'm into business, music, and coding, among other things. Sometimes I'll have ideas or projects that I deem interesting enough to post here, but most of the time they'll probably end up in the trash. 

Here's a link to [my Github](https://github.com/ken-myers/) if you want to stalk me there.
