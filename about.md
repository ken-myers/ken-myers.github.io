i am a
c.s. student at ut dallas.
software dev intern at bell flight.
amateur musician.
wannabe traveller and entrepreneur.
sometimes fitness enthusiast. 

i made this site
to keep track of my projects and keep myself accountable in that regard.
and to serve as a professional portfolio.
and so my email domain wouldn't point to a registrar parking page.
