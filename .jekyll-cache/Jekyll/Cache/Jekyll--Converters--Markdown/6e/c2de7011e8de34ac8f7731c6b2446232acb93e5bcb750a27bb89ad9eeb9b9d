<p>There was something of a family debate over whether a reduced-dimensionality starmap could still be accurate enough as to be useful, so I made a covid-quarantine experiment of it.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>The idea is pretty simple: create a 2D starmap in which the distances between each star are as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>I tried to implement something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">Kohonen map</a>. I‚Äôm not sure if it actually falls under that name, but it does follow the same principles of iteratively changing the position of each node towards a more ideal state, which in this case would be one in which the distances between each pair on the board are most accurate. Here‚Äôs my algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Randomly initialize each item‚Äôs position.</li>
  <li>Repeat the following n times or until convergence:
    <ul>
      <li>For each item in the dataset:
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate and store the average pairwise error (discrepancy between true distance and distance on the map) between the given item and all other items</li>
          <li>Shift the item‚Äôs position by a certain increment in both directions on each axis, calculating and storing the item‚Äôs average error for each possible move.</li>
          <li>Commit the move which yields the lowest error, and move onto the next item.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the average error of the whole map has not changed since last iteration, either
        <ul>
          <li>Decrease the increment size if the results will still be significant, or otherwise</li>
          <li>Stop. The map‚Äôs error has converged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A few nuances have been glossed over in this overview. You can view the full code on my Github.</p>

<p>One of the principal arguments against the usability of these maps was that ‚Äúit‚Äôs like putting cities in a line.‚Äù I made sure to generalize my code for data of any dimension and fed it the largest 20 cities in Texas. If you‚Äôre from around here, I think you‚Äôd agree with me that this map seems like it would be of aid to any one-dimensional creatures attempting to traverse the state.</p>

<p>As for the error indication, the blue lines represent specific distances that are over a user-inputted threshold (in this case, 85%), the text simply lists the average error of all distances involving the given star, and the red halos are proportional to said error. All of this is toggle-able.</p>

<p>Something to note is that these maps are quite sensitive to initial conditions, so you may have to re-roll a few times until you get a map you‚Äôre happy with. In my experience, the average map error for a given dataset could fall anywhere between 10-30%, but I‚Äôm sure this number changes when you‚Äôre working with something other than stars or cities.</p>

<p>Even though the code is capable, there‚Äôs not much use in stepping down higher-dimensional data to one, two, or three dimensions because, since it is primarily intended to be used as a cartography tool, my program does not normalize the data you feed it, and uniform higher dimensional coordinates are hard to come by. (If you were, say, a novelist trying to world-build a universe in which there were seven spacial dimensions, then yes, it could be useful.)</p>

<p>I intend to continue working on this project. Besides the obvious refactoring, bug-squashing, and polishing, I‚Äôd also like to add support for wrap-around/toroidal space, and perhaps globular.</p>
